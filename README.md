# 🛠️ CompTIA A+ Study Repository

Welcome to my CompTIA A+ study repo!  
I'm currently preparing for both Core 1 (220-1101) and Core 2 (220-1102) exams.

This repo contains:
- ✅ A+ Study Checklist (`study-checklist.md`)
- 📚 A growing list of resources and links (`resources.md`)
- 📝 Notes and concepts I’ve reviewed (`notes.md`)

## 🎯 Goals
- Pass the CompTIA A+ exams by mid August
- Build foundational IT knowledge for cybersecurity and networking careers
- Keep track of progress and stay organized

## 📌 Why I'm Sharing This
I'm a veteran transitioning into tech and want to document my learning publicly to stay accountable and hopefully help others starting out.
